# Geothermal Machine Learning Project

This project explores the application of machine learning techniques to geothermal energy exploration and production optimization. It was developed as part of a geothermal hackathon focused on innovative solutions leveraging ML and data science.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop predictive models and data-driven workflows to:
- Identify high-potential geothermal sites based on geological, geophysical and geochemical data
- Optimize geothermal well placement and production parameters 
- Forecast geothermal reservoir performance and sustainability

## Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset combining information from various sources:
- Geological maps and cross-sections
- Geophysical surveys (seismic, gravity, resistivity, etc.)
- Geochemical analyses of water and rock samples
- Temperature measurements and well logs from existing geothermal fields
- Production history and operational data from geothermal power plants

## Methodology

Several machine learning approaches are explored, including:
- Supervised learning for geothermal favorability mapping and resource estimation
- Unsupervised learning for data segmentation and pattern recognition 
- Reinforcement learning for production optimization
- Deep learning for feature extraction and end-to-end modeling

The ML pipeline includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training/validation, and performance assessment. Popular Python libraries such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow and PyTorch are used.
