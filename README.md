# Geothermal Machine Learning Project

This project explores the application of machine learning techniques to geothermal energy exploration and production optimization. It was developed as part of a geothermal hackathon focused on innovative solutions leveraging ML and data science.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop predictive models and data-driven workflows to:
- Identify high-potential geothermal sites based on geological, geophysical and geochemical data
- Optimize geothermal well placement and production parameters 
- Forecast geothermal reservoir performance and sustainability

## Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset combining information from various sources:
- Geological maps and cross-sections
- Geophysical surveys (seismic, gravity, resistivity, etc.)
- Geochemical analyses of water and rock samples
- Temperature measurements and well logs from existing geothermal fields
- Production history and operational data from geothermal power plants

## Methodology

in preparation

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Input datasets and data preprocessing scripts
